## RAG - Grounding with Google Search

In generative AI, grounding is the ability to connect model output to verifiable sources of information. If you provide models with access to specific data sources, then grounding tethers their output to these data and reduces the chances of inventing content. This is particularly important in situations where accuracy and reliability are significant.

Grounding provides the following benefits:

- Reduces model hallucinations, which are instances where the model generates content that isn't factual.
- Anchors model responses to specific information.
- Enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of the generated content.

When you use Grounding with Google Search, it links the Google model to the internet. Since non-grounded generative AI model responses are considered new content based on learned patterns, you won't get factual responses which are time specific, for example, asking what the weather forecast is in your prompt. Since the internet provides access to existing and new information, a grounded prompt can give you nuanced and specific prompt responses, with little error, and with its sources cited.
